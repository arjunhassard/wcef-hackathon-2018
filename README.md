# Background info about NuCypher

NuCypher is a key management system which leverages proxy re-encryption to control access over encrypted data.
You can find the white paper [here](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2807639/NuCypher%20KMS%20Technical%20White%20Paper.pdf?t=1510526466105) (although you don't have to read it all!).
If you have any questions, you can ask in person at the hackathon, or go to our [developer slack channel](https://nucypher-kms-slack.herokuapp.com/).
